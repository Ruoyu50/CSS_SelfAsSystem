Self as System (F25)

Overview

This project explores the theme of self as system through personal data analysis and iterative creative processes. Using Spotify listening history as the dataset, I examined how digital traces reflect or distort personal identity. The process included reflection on data, creating 3-in-3 prototypes, and developing a final web-based self-portrait using interactive hexagons to represent moods, attention, and meaning derived from listening experiences.

Background & Reflection
	•	Classical and contemporary notions of self often emphasize the body, soul, and cultural constructs.
	•	Digital platforms reduce the self to patterns of behavior (listening, skipping, searching), yet these abstractions cannot capture personal context such as mood or environment.
	•	My reflection questions the possibility of “designing the self.” I argue that self-awareness must precede any design, and algorithmic projections should be seen as partial, not absolute.

Dataset
	•	Source: Spotify Streaming History (JSON)
	•	Key Variables: artist_name, track_name, ms_played, skipped, ts
	•	Tools: Excel (data cleaning, pivot tables, charts)

Findings:
	•	Expected: HOYO-MiX dominated my top artists.
	•	Unexpected: Bury the Light was my most played track despite ambivalence toward it.
	•	Missing: Context such as my mood, attention, or reasons for listening.

Process

Phase 1: Data Download & Reflection
	•	Extracted and cleaned JSON data.
	•	Converted timestamps, durations, and built pivot charts.
	•	Reflected on gaps between logged activity and lived experience.

Phase 2: 3-in-3 Prototypes
	•	Prototype 1: Cross-referenced listening with diaries, mapped certainty using lightness.
	•	Prototype 2: Analyzed skipped songs as indicators of hidden preferences.
	•	Prototype 3: Focused on overlooked tracks as possible self-portrait elements.

Phase 3: Iterative Self-Portrait
	•	Chose Prototype 1 (music + diary comparison).
	•	Developed interactive hexagon visualization:
	•	Six attributes: Energy, Emotion, Attention, Motivation, Engagement, Meaning.
	•	Colors mapped to moods; certainty shown by saturation/lightness.
	•	Hexagons move, rotate, and interact, representing the dynamic and uncertain nature of self.

Final Deliverables
	•	Website URL: (insert your final site link)
	•	Final PDF Submission: includes Data Reflection, Project Description, and Presentation link.
	•	Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (p5.js), Excel for preprocessing.

Future Iterations
	•	Incorporate real-time mood tracking.
	•	Add diary sentiment analysis for deeper integration.
	•	Extend interactions into a networked visualization.
