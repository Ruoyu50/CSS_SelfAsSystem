# Self as System (F25)

## Overview
This project explores the theme of self as system through personal data analysis and iterative creative processes. Using Spotify listening history as the dataset, I examined how digital traces reflect or distort personal identity. The process included reflection on data, creating 3-in-3 prototypes, and developing a final web-based self-portrait using interactive hexagons to represent moods, attention, and meaning derived from listening experiences.

## Background & Reflection
•Classical and contemporary notions of self often emphasize the body, soul, and cultural constructs.
•Digital platforms reduce the self to patterns of behavior (listening, skipping, searching), yet these abstractions cannot capture personal context such as mood or environment.
•My reflection questions the possibility of “designing the self.” I argue that self-awareness must precede any design, and algorithmic projections should be seen as partial, not absolute.


## Dataset Used
•Source: Spotify Streaming History (JSON)
•Key Variables: artist_name, track_name, ms_played, skipped, ts
•Tools: Excel (data cleaning, pivot tables, charts)

## Findings
•Expected: HOYO-MiX dominated my top artists.
•Unexpected: Bury the Light was my most played track despite ambivalence toward it.
•Missing: Context such as my mood, attention, or reasons for listening.


## Process
### Phase 1: Data Download & Reflection(08/28/2025)
•Extracted and cleaned JSON data.
•Converted timestamps, durations, and built pivot charts.
•Reflected on gaps between logged activity and lived experience.

### Phase 2: 3-in-3 Prototypes(09/04/2025)
•Prototype 1: Cross-referenced listening with diaries, mapped certainty using lightness.
•Prototype 2: Analyzed skipped songs as indicators of hidden preferences.
•Prototype 3: Focused on overlooked tracks as possible self-portrait elements.

### Phase 3: Iterative Self-Portrait(09/11/2025)
•Chose Prototype 1 (music + diary comparison).
•Developed interactive hexagon visualization:
•Six attributes: Energy, Emotion, Attention, Motivation, Engagement, Meaning.
•Colors mapped to moods; certainty shown by saturation/lightness.
•Hexagons move, rotate, and interact, representing the dynamic and uncertain nature of self.

### Tech Stack:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (p5.js), Excel for preprocessing.


## Future Iterations
•Incorporate real-time mood tracking.
•Add diary sentiment analysis for deeper integration.
•Extend interactions into a networked visualization and sonification.
